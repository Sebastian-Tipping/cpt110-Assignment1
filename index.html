<p>
  I was born in Melbourne and have lived here all my life but have travelled around. <br>
  I am European and only speak English.
</p>

<p>
  I Am working on finishing high school through HomeSchooling by doing MathsTrack though Adelaide University:<a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/mathslearning/bridging/">https://www.adelaide.edu.au/mathslearning/bridging/</a>  <br>
  I have also done 2 previous University courses which have been General Physics though Murdoch University and then Introduction to Programming though RIMT
</p>

<p>
  I have my own custom rig that I built a little over 2 years ago and love to play a variety of games.<br>
  <img src="img/computer.jpg" alt="My computer" width= 400px><br>
  I also have started playing dungeons and dragons lately and have really started to like it<br>
</p>

<h1>
Interest in IT
</h1>

<p>
I have been around computers as long as I can remember and have always been fascinated by them. My earliest memories are of me playing games like Diablo 2 with my parents. <br>
I Like to explore what we can do with computers and IT in general and also worry about what people can do with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions <br>
<br>
I decided to start with RMIT when looking at what courses interested me and what universities were doing these courses and saw that RMIT had a quite good looking IT course which seemed interesting <br>
<br>
I hope to learn some of the basics that come with coding like what we have learned with GitHub as before now I had almost no idea what it was or what it did and hopefully in later courses some more in-depth stuff such as python or Kali Linux
</p>

    This position includes leading a small team, planning and executing attacks attempting to breach the NetBank system looking for flaws<br>
    Then relaying what you find to knowledgeable and not so knowledgeable people so they can understand the problems or flaws<br>
    Both the planning and executing attacks and the relaying information are what I believe that I would really like to do and the leading of the team would be something that comes with the role. <br>
    <br>
    The Qualifications required would be the ability to work in and lead a group of people.<br>
    Understanding of multiple programming languages and the tools that are required for penetration tests.<br>
    <br>
    I can work in teams but am still uncomfortable to lead them and get quite nervous when I need to lead a group of people in something.<br>
    There are a few languages that I have a small amount of knowledge in including java, python.<br>
    I can present a report/speech if necessary but still struggle with my nerves.
    <br>
    I wish to get more programming knowledge from a few courses that I have found.<br>
    More public speaking from courses like this which require presenting an idea or project.<br>
    And working and leading a team from working in groups in courses.

  I find it a lot easier to learn if someone talks or lists through the steps<br>
  <br>
  That I might need someone to explain something to me instead of just showing me through it<br>
  <br>
  I should find at least one person who can work out by seeing or doing what needs doing then explain that to me in words or the other way around if we are going to get verbally told what needs doing I can then explain to other people visually<br>

<h1>
Project Idea
</h1>

<h2>
overview
</h2>

<p>
  A security RFID card which you would use to replace or make passwords more secure or to encrypt files on your computer or device.<br>
  It would work like a myki or similar with a scanner built into your computer/phone or whatever else you want to use.<br>
  So you would just scan your card it would take that signal and then unlock a folder or log you into an application or website either skipping a password or working like a 2-factor authenticator but without requiring you to write the code down making it quicker and easier for use.<br>
</p>

<h2>
Motivation
</h2>

<p>
  People don't like complicated passwords so they make them simple and easy to remember, which is problematic because they are then easy to hack.<br>
  One option is to write your password down somewhere (I know a lot of people write them on sticky note they put on their monitor) or to use a password manager which works till you forget the password to that or someone else gets Into it in which case you may as well have no password at all.<br>
  This could replace the need for passwords as an offsite key that is more secure and easier to remember than a long password<br>
</p>

<h2>
Description
</h2>

<p>

  The device would have 2 different parts.  The first part which would be the card which would have an RFID chip inside of it. The RFID chip would be unique to the user, which would be scanned on the back of your phone, on your laptop, etc.<br>
  <br>
  The reason for these cards is they are relatively to manufacture and program with the right tools, while they are small enough to fit in your wallet easily making them harder to lose than a separate object.<br>
  <br>
  The second part would be the scanners on your devices. This scanner could be built into your phone, laptop or computer alternatively it could be built as a stand-alone device that could be plugged in via USB to make it compatible with older technology,<br>
  The scanner would send out a pulse then receive an input from the chip in the card then pass it through a hashing and salting process followed by checking it to a database to see if it matches a master key also unique to the user showing that it is the right card.<br>
  <br>
  This would make a system which is portable because all you would really need is the card and a device which can read the card ideally your computer or phone which you plan to access the data on. Meaning if you were to be working on some sensitive files at while at home (If they were uploaded to the cloud) and wanted to continue working on them while out or at work, you could unlock the files just by tapping your card on your computer.<br>
  <br>
  You could also make multiple cards which have the same key for multiple users working on the same project, so companies who work on very important information could get a set of cards for one project and hand them out to only the people allowed to access the data.<br>
  <br>
  It would also be easy to give someone the account or the file just by giving them the physical card like if you want to sell an account you need to change all the details or worry about the original user getting back on or if you want to share an account you need to change the password to something you tell them then change it back after you want to stop sharing the account. With this system, you could just give them the card for a week then when you get the card back you know for sure they can not get back in without a lot of effort<br>
  <br>
  Then the device would unlock the said folder or application with no more than just a quick tap from the user making the need for a complicated password less necessary. Making easier and quicker for the user while being more secure than a basic password.<br>
</p>

<h2>
Tools and Technologies
</h2>

<p>
  You would require the means to make or obtain both the Cards with the RFID chips as well as the receivers.<br>
  <br>
  Working with other companies to get the receivers built into their products would be helpful so people would not need the standalone receivers making the package that you need to carry smaller and making the use quicker and easier<br>
  <br>
  you would also need to program the chips with a random set of characters which is encrypted and then uploaded to a database that you would need to host as well as designing and developing an app that the user would install or have prebuilt into the device to take the data from the RFID chip, verify then unlock or login to whatever you are trying to access.<br>
</p>

<h2>
Skill required
</h2>

<p>
  Some of the skills required would involve knowledge of making the RFID cards and how to program them.<br>
  <br>
  Someone would also need to know how to design, prototype and then build the receivers, and the housing for the stand-alone models<br>
  It would also be helpful to have someone work with other companies for their products to have the receivers<br>
  <br>
  It would require knowledge of designing and managing a database to store the binary codes the cards have programmed to them.<br>
  <br>
  Another thing that would be required is someone who can design the program that takes the signal, checks it by comparing it to the database and then unlocking the front end for the user.<br>
</p>

<h2>
Outcome
</h2>

<p>
Should this work than long and complicated passwords that can be forgotten will be less necessary and accounts will be more secure.<br>
Logging into your account or trying to access private data will be quicker and easier as just one tap will log you in.<br>
Also since there will be no need to enter a password you will also be safer from things from attacks like keylogging making your accounts more secure from hacking.<br>
<br>
So with this working out Cybersecurity will be increased but the ease of access into your accounts will be increased as well.<br>
